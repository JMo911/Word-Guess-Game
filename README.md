# Word-Guess-Game

The purpose of this project is to create an entertaining hangman style game that will encourage my users to travel the world. Each term that the user tries to guess will be a country. Upon correctly guessing the country, my users will see one cool photo from that country and be able to read a couple of interesting facts about the country.

This should be sure to make your travel bug each!

Welcome to 'Around the World!'
